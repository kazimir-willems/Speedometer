# Speedometer
This is an android speedometer app which works pretty much like the digital speedometers we encounter on our motor vehicles. You need to enable GPS on your device to let the speedometer function. It calculates and displays on the device screen the distance travelled in kilometers, speed in km/hr and time in minutes.I hope you like this app and find it useful.
